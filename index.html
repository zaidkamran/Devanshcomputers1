    <h2>Are Free Coding Classes</h2>
    <p>
        Whether a free coding course is worth your time depends on what youâ€™re looking for. Are you a complete beginner who is learning a programming language from scratch? <br>
         Do you only want to learn a programming language or do you want it taught in the context of a profession? How important to you is receiving feedback from instructors, <br>
          or interactions with peers in the form of portfolio reviews, collaboration, and accountability?
